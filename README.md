# Project Happy Thoughts API

This is the backend for the Happy Thoughts project, a simple API that enables users to share their positive thoughts and like thoughts posted by others. The goal is to create a functional and accessible API using modern web development technologies.

## The problem

The goal of this project was to create an API that allows users to share positive thoughts and like others' posts. To achieve this, I used Express.js for server-side logic, MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage and validation, and dotenv for environment variables. The API includes endpoints to post new thoughts, fetch the 20 most recent thoughts, and like posts, with sorting and error handling to ensure a smooth experience.
